# Project summary

## Defintion of the problem

We tried to resolve problem of calculating risk that women with irregular menstrual period heave some serious health issues. If someone has irregular menstrual period or other problem with vaginal bleeding it can be sign of some problems that need medical attencion. If application can inform them that they are at risk, that can be very useful, because some of these problems need time to develop.

## Our approach

If someone is diagnosed with some of these deseases, and have symptoms that can be recognized by ai, than it can help to calculate risk. We had in mind 5 health problems Polycystic ovary syndrome, Hypothyroidism, Endometrial cancer, Pituarity tumors, Anorexia nervosa. Programm have to learn about symptoms of these deseases, and predict if someone is at risk. We take informations from women about symptoms, and ai learns when it can be something serious.  Informations include different symptoms that can refer to one or more of these 5 conditions .

## Why does it matters

Prevention is key word here. Some of these conditions can develop very slowly, and sometimes one can not be aware of them. Some of symptoms look very light, but combination of them can refer to serious health problems.

## Our results and potential impact

Results depends of database that program can make. This can help to women that heave no knowledge of these medical conditions to see doctor in early fase. That gives them chanse to be treated properly and prevent development. Some of these problems heave bad predictions for vitality and life itself. Result can be very bad. Preventing these conditions is very important.
